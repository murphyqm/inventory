:::{.stat-block}
### Here's a little statblock

Here is some text inside the stat block

Here is some more text
:::

</br>

:::{.stat-block-wide}

Here is a wide/flexi callout block, with no title included. 

:::

</br>

You can also put these in columns etc. as desired.

Currently, this is what code blocks look like:

```python
# This is a comment

x = 34
y =23
z = x * y
```

I would like to style these as a scroll or in a way that matches the stat block.
